= Exercise Three - Working with Inventory Groups

For our example, I created 2 EC2 instances with the `user_id` value of student1. You can see his Inventory Group in Figure 17, above. Let's make sure his systems are up and available. We can do this with his Inventory Group. For this exercise, do the same thing with your inventory group.

[TIP]
.For this lab substitute your own Inventory Group for `tag_user_id_student1`.
====
. In the Inventories page, check the box next to the `tag_user_id_student1` group and click the image:button_run_commands.png[Title="Run Commands Button"] button that became available when you selected the group.
. In the new dialog box that opens up, select the 'Ping' module and use our `ansible-lab-instances` Machine Credential.
. Click the image:button_launch_text.png[Title="Launch Button"] button, to execute the job.
====

If all goes well, we will get a pong back from all of your systems.

With a few mouse clicks, we can run powerful arbitrary commands on any subset of our infrastructure. Pretty Awesome!

[TIP]
You can, of course, select multiple groups, or individual hosts, before launching your Commands.
