= Workshop Lab Setup

Workshop Infrastructure
****
[IMPORTANT]
Today's workshop infrastructure is being run in Amazon EC2. +
Each of you should have received a printout when you arrived today.  It has the following information on it. +
- *EC2 username/password* +
- *IP Addresses for each of your EC2 instances* +
If you didn't get one of these printouts, let us know so we can give you one.

****
Each student's personal EC2 lab is equipped with the following:
****
* (1) Control node (to run ansible plays and install Ansible Tower).
* (2) Endpoint nodes (to execute ansible playbooks upon).
** _All three of the afore mentioned nodes are running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2_
* Ansible Core 2.2
* Ansible Tower 3.0.3

.Setup Your Environment
****
Before we can begin doing super-cool automations and such, we've got to get a few basics out of the way.
Namely... ssh access to your EC2 nodes.

Testing your environment

[NOTE]
.Testing your access
====
* Open a terminal or terminal emulator (like PuTTy)
* ssh to each one of your EC2 nodes/instances using ssh.
* ssh <account name>@<IP address of node>
- EXAMPLE: ```ssh bhirsch@52.62.1.8```
====

[IMPORTANT]
Be sure you can log in to your ec2 instances.  If you can't log in start shouting, loudly, and waving your hands!

End Result

At this point, everyone should have logged into each of your 3 nodes.  If you haven't, let us know so we can get you fixed up.
